Vanilla cupcakes may seem a little too “classic,” but honestly, sometimes that’s just what you need! 
You can make these cupcakes casual or fancy, so they’re a great treat to make for everything from birthday parties to lazy 
Saturday afternoons when you’re craving something sweet. I love the combination of moist vanilla cupcakes with silky smooth vanilla buttercream. I truly can’t say enough good things about these cupcakes!

Make sure you cream the butter, sugar, oil and vanilla completely. 
This will ensure that your cupcakes turn out perfect and that they’re not too dense.
It’s a good idea to add a bit more milk or water if your frosting comes out too thick. 
Do this a little at a time to avoid thinning it out too much.
Let your cupcakes cool completely before you frost them. If you don’t, the buttercream will melt and 
all your pretty piping will be ruined. You want the frosting to stay smooth and velvety.
